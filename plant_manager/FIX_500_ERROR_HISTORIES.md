# Fix: 500 Error on /plants/id/histories

## Problem
User reported: "plants:1432 GET http://127.0.0.1:8001/plants/101/histories 500 (Internal Server Error)" when creating watering/fertilizing records via the quick modal in the plants list.

The error occurred when:
1. User creates a watering or fertilization record via the quick modal
2. The AJAX handler calls `reloadHistoriesInModal()`
3. Which makes a GET request to `/plants/101/histories`
4. The controller loads the histories via eager loading
5. The partial views tried to query the relationships again, causing an error

## Root Cause
The partial views (`fertilizing-history-modal.blade.php`, `watering-history-modal.blade.php`, `repotting-history-modal.blade.php`) were calling the relationship methods as query builders:

```blade
@php
    $lastFertilizing = $plant->fertilizingHistories()->latest('fertilizing_date')->first();
@endphp
```

However, the controller in `PlantController::histories()` was using `$plant->load()` to eager-load the relationships:

```php
$plant->load([
    'tags',
    'wateringHistories',
    'fertilizingHistories.fertilizerType',
    'repottingHistories',
]);
```

When relations are eager-loaded with `load()`, they become collections, not query builders. Calling `()` on a collection or trying to chain query methods could cause issues or undefined behavior.

## Solution
Changed the partial views to work with collections directly instead of trying to re-query the relationships:

### Before:
```blade
@php
    $lastFertilizing = $plant->fertilizingHistories()->latest('fertilizing_date')->first();
@endphp
```

### After:
```blade
@php
    $lastFertilizing = collect($plant->fertilizingHistories ?? [])->sortByDesc('fertilizing_date')->first();
@endphp
```

This ensures:
1. We use the already-loaded collection
2. We safely handle cases where the relation might not exist
3. We use collection methods (`sortByDesc`) instead of query builder methods (`latest`)
