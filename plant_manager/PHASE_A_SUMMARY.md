# Phase A - Export Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

## Accomplishments

### 1. Export Service & CLI Command
- ✅ `BackupService.php` - Core backup logic with versioning (v1) and SHA256 checksums
- ✅ `PlantsExport.php` - Artisan command with `--include-photos` flag
- ✅ ZIP file generation with JSON backup + metadata + photos
- ✅ Backup storage: `storage/app/backups/` with timestamp-based organization

**Test Command:**
```bash
php artisan plants:export --include-photos
# Output: ✓ Export completed successfully!
#         Filename: export_2025-10-21_19-26-42_5fd69798-fac0-4af7-8856-82edaafc0f1e.zip
#         Size: 1.71 MB
```

### 2. HTTP Endpoints & Authorization
- ✅ `BackupController.php` - REST endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ✅ `AdminMiddleware.php` - Admin-only authorization checks
- ✅ Routes protected under `auth` + `admin` middleware
- ✅ Routes registered in `web.php` with proper grouping

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /settings/backups` - View backups page (admin-only)
- `POST /settings/backups/export` - Trigger export (AJAX, admin-only)
- `GET /settings/backups/download/{filename}` - Download backup
- `DELETE /settings/backups/{filename}` - Delete backup

### 3. UI & User Interface
- ✅ `resources/views/settings/backups/index.blade.php` - Backup management page
- ✅ Export form with checkbox for photo inclusion
- ✅ Backup history table with metadata (filename, size, plant count, date)
- ✅ Download and delete action buttons
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling consistent with app design
- ✅ Lucide icons for visual enhancement

### 4. Authentication System
- ✅ Laravel Breeze integration (production-ready auth)
- ✅ User email verification requirement
- ✅ Admin user flag (`is_admin` column on users table)
- ✅ Auth routes: login, register, password reset, email verification
- ✅ Protected app routes with `[auth, verified]` middleware

**Test Users:**
```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
is_admin: YES

Email: test@example.com
Password: password
is_admin: NO
```

### 5. Database & Model Updates
- ✅ Migration: `2025_10_16_add_is_admin_to_users_table.php`
- ✅ User model updated with `is_admin` field and cast
- ✅ Seeder updated to create admin user

### 6. Tests
- ✅ `tests/Feature/AuthenticationTest.php` - 7 comprehensive test cases
  - Login page accessibility
  - User authentication (valid/invalid credentials)
  - Plant access authorization
  - Admin backup access control

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files (10)
1. `app/Services/BackupService.php` (295 lines)
2. `app/Console/Commands/PlantsExport.php` (68 lines)
3. `app/Http/Controllers/BackupController.php` (108 lines)
4. `app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php` (26 lines)
5. `resources/views/settings/backups/index.blade.php` (141 lines)
6. `database/migrations/2025_10_16_add_is_admin_to_users_table.php`
7. `tests/Feature/AuthenticationTest.php` (77 lines)
8. Multiple Breeze auth files (controllers, views, migrations)

### Modified Files (5)
- `routes/web.php` - Added backup routes and auth middleware grouping
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Registered AdminMiddleware alias
- `app/Models/User.php` - Added is_admin field and cast
- `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` - Create admin user
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Updated for Breeze + custom support

## Data Flow

```
User (Admin) 
  ↓
Login (Breeze) 
  ↓
/settings/backups (auth + admin middleware) 
  ↓
Export Button → BackupController@export 
  ↓
BackupService::export()
  ├─ collectData() → Serialize plants + relations
  ├─ addPhotosToZip() → Copy photos to archive
  ├─ Generate metadata.json (checksum, counts)
  └─ Store in storage/app/backups/
  ↓
ZIP file available for download
```

## Security Measures

✅ Admin authorization required for all backup operations  
✅ Filename validation in BackupController (prevents path traversal)  
✅ Email verification required (Breeze standard)  
✅ CSRF token protection on forms  
✅ Checksums included for integrity verification  
✅ Audit logs in `storage/logs/backups.log`  

## Statistics

- **Commits:** 2 major commits (Phase A + Breeze integration)
- **Lines of Code:** ~1000+ (services, controllers, views, tests)
- **Test Coverage:** 7 authentication tests
- **Export Test:** ✅ Successful (1.71 MB ZIP with 30 plants + photos)
