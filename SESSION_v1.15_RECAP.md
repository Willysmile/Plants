## 🎯 Session Objectives - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Quick Modal Standardization ✅
- [x] Implement quick disease modal (component + handlers)
- [x] Ensure consistency across all 4 quick modals (watering, fertilizing, repotting, disease)
- [x] Fix modal refresh issues - use `window.refreshModal()` consistently
- [x] Add date validation (no future dates) to all modals
- [x] Setup functions called when modals open

### 2. Disease History Feature ✅
- [x] Create disease-history index page with full listing
- [x] Add route `plants.disease-history.index` with proper controller method
- [x] Display disease cards with colored status badges (detected, treated, cured, recurring)
- [x] Add treatment date and treatment description fields
- [x] Make disease card title clickable link to history page
- [x] Remove "Voir" button - only "Créer →" button in card
- [x] Remove obsolete disease viewing modale from plants modal

### 3. Form Validation ✅
- [x] Fix date validation for treated_at field (must be >= detected_at)
- [x] Add client-side validation before form submission
- [x] Add server-side validation in controller
- [x] Test date constraints work consistently on modal and show page

### 4. Show Page Integration ✅
- [x] Include quick-disease-modal component on show page
- [x] Add wrapper functions for disease modal (open, close, setup)
- [x] Override refreshModal() to reload page instead of search for modal-content
- [x] Test disease modal works when clicking "Créer →" on show page

### 5. UI/UX Fixes ✅
- [x] Replace emoji icons with proper Lucide icons
- [x] Add colored status badges with dot indicators
- [x] Fix status label translations (hardcoded labels instead of missing .lang file)
- [x] Fix icon names (edit-2 → pencil, trash-2 → trash)

### 6. Testing ✅
- [x] Test quick modals open on both index and show pages
- [x] Test form submission via AJAX
- [x] Test date validation (past OK, future blocked)
- [x] Test notification display after submission
- [x] Test page reload/refresh after AJAX submit
- [x] Verify disease card displays correctly in both contexts

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modal Management**: Centralized QuickModalsManager for consistency
2. **Date Validation**: Both client-side (instant feedback) + server-side (security)
3. **Refresh Strategy**: Context-aware (modal for index, reload for show)
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly notifications vs. console errors

### Best Practices Applied
1. **DRY Principle**: Reuse components across contexts
2. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading, CSS class caching
4. **Security**: CSRF tokens, input validation, output escaping
